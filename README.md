Christophanous Radiance Modulator, Model 114B (CRM-114B)

Precision manual PWM is used to create visually appealing colored light patterns. The original application was for a Christmas tree star topper in the form of an Ikea STRALA fiber optic light fixture (discontinued, see https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00B29CVR8?tag=mydegun-20) retrofitted with an ATtiny2313A microcontroller controlling a 3-watt RGB LED. Control of the pattern mode, speed, and intensity is provided with a rotary encoder. This original application was an entry to the Hackaday 1kB Challenge.
